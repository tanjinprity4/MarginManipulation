   Computers are widely used to help produce written documents.  One 
   desirable capability of a word processing system is margin manipulation.  
   This enables text to be formatted with a left and right margin selected 
   by a user.  The word processing program allocates words to lines in order 
   to satisfy the margin requirements.
